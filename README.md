# catch-this
Spring Boot app to display catch probabilities using MLB's Baseball Savant API

todo:
1. use gamePk to get date of game
  a. create game model and set up like fetchPlayer etc.
  b. sort by date desc by default
2. add more useful columns to be displayed: opponent team? stadium? batter?
3. ****link to the actual catch video on baseballsavant****
   a. perhaps with the gamePk+playId?
5. make prettier
